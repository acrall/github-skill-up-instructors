You can also practice your GitHub skills using the Carpentries lessons!
There is a [Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) that lists issues 
that are looking for someone to implement a fix.  I recommend looking for issues with the label 
"good first issue" as these are identified as issues that may be easier to solve.

Remember for follow-up questions or help, you can join the #first-time-contributors channel on slack or email [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
