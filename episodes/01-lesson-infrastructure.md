:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How are files/folders in the Carpentries Workbench organized?
- How do I find information on the Carpentries Workbench?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Navigate the Carpentries Workbench Structure
- Look up info in the Workbench docs

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

<!--- Outline 
1. [Setup ahead] Instructor creates test repo with X issues and shares with learners
	- X = the number of learners +2
	- Ideally, issues are not on the same pages so they don't cause conflicts, or we plan to teach conflicts (which could be a good way to have learners practice editing PRs)
2. Instructor shows the repo vs the rendered website
3. While exploring the rendered website we discover a problem
4. Look for an issue on the problem in the repo
5. To fix the issue, we need to look something up in the workbench docs.  Instructor shows the Workbench file structure in the repo and the docs to look something up
6. Exercise 1:  Look something up in the Workbench Docs
